## üìö Description

We create a project folder called QR code generator. Inside this folder, we have three files. These files are index.html, style.css and script.js. The first file is the HTML document, the next is the style sheet and finally we have the script file.

**HTML:**
We start with the HTML code. The HTML code creates the layout and structure of our application.

**CSS:**
Next, we design the application and place various elements and options using CSS.

**JavaScript:**
Next, we implement the functionality using JavaScript, we implement the functionality using the following steps:

- Create initial reference
- Add event listener to set the size
- Add an event listener to set the background
- Set foreground colour with an event listener
- Format the input
- Add event listener to Submit button
- Set URL to download
- Validate user input
- Function on window loading
